# Functional Programing in Scala

## Week 1
> squre root function in scala
> syntax in scala
    
## week 2
> assignment pascal triangle.
    
## week 3
> Higer order functions: passing fn as argument

> Currying : passing and returning fn as argument

> Fixed point : finding a fixed points of a function. example like squre root and factorial

> Classes in scala and methods and exception handling

## Week 4
> Class Hierarchies using Rational Number operations

> Polymorphism using binary tree and list operations

## Week 5
> Higer-Order list functions like scaling a List or appling a map(scaling function) to a list

> Merge-Sort strategies on lists and parameterization(for any type using a boolean check and then removal of boolean check using implicit Ordering) of algo.
    
> More functions on lists like flattening, removing algorithm

## Week 6
> pairs and Tuples examples

> Vectors and Map in scala 

> Queens Problem in Scala using above concepts

> Polynomials addition strategies 

> In phone number encodeing to words i.e. all the possible phrases for a given number
